(Verse 1)
Rivers flow, clear and slow,
Nature's song, flowing strong,

(Chorus)
Waters pure, life's allure.
Feel the cleansing rain
Crystal streams, hopeful dreams,
Wipe away our stain

(Verse 2)
Blue and bright, in sunlight
Rivers heal, with natureâ€™s zeal,  

(Chorus)
Waters pure, life's allure.
Feel the cleansing rain
Crystal streams, hopeful dreams,
Wipe away our stain

(Bridge)
Gentle tide, side by side,
Nature's plea, rivers free,
Flowing truth, renewed youth,
In their course, hope's force.
