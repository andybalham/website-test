(Verse 1)
Shadows fall, close-minded call,
Words like knives, troubled lives,

(Chorus)
Echoed fears, bitter tears,
Walls built high, 
Angry cries, compassion dies,
empathy's sigh,
Echoed fears, bitter tears,
Of hate's form.
Angry cries, compassion dies,
In the storm, 

(Verse 2)
Intolerance breeds, unkind deeds,
Hearts of stone, of hate grown.

(Bridge)
Darkened view, kindness eschew,
Unyielding mind, to hatred blind,
Rifts run deep, no peace in sleep,
Intolerance's hold, bold and cold.
