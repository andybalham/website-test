(Verse 1)
At every turn, promises break, 
At every turn, trust they take
At every turn, empty words, 
At every turn, voices unheard,

(Chorus)
In the halls of spin, no one ever wins
Frustration's tide, deep and wide.

At every turn, voices rise
At every turn, spreading lies
At every turn, in power's seat
At every turn, deceit repeats.

(Chorus)
In the halls of spin, no one ever wins
Frustration's tide, deep and wide.

(Solo)

(Chorus)
In the halls of spin, no one ever wins
Frustration's tide, deep and wide.
