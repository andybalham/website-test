(Verse 1)
Dark brew flow, 
John's pockets grow,
Golden foam, 
a wealth he'd own,

(Chorus)
Pints on shelves, John thinks of himself,
Black gold stout, greed without doubt,
Tap's allure, riches pure,
In every sip, John's tight grip.

(Verse 2)
Guinness glass
In first class,
Bar's loud cheer
Profits clear.

(Chorus)
Pints on shelves, John thinks of himself,
Black gold stout, greed without doubt,
Tap's allure, riches pure,
In every sip, John's tight grip.

(Bridge)
Legacy tall, John won't let fall,
From Dublin's heart, greed's art,
Silky pour, wanting more,
For Guinness' fame, John stakes his claim.

(Chorus)
Pints on shelves, John thinks of himself,
Black gold stout, greed without doubt,
Tap's allure, riches pure,
In every sip, John's tight grip.
