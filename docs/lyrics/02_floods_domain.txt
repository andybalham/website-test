(Verse 1)
Beneath the rising tides
There is nowhere to hide
At the sight of darkened skies
We hear a mother's cries

(Verse 2)
Behold the water's wrath
Wreaks its deadly path,
Homes become submerged
Fear and water surge

(Chorus)
The rain won't cease, no peace
River's roar, shores no more
The waves crash in, drown sin
In the flood's domain
 
(Bridge)
Whirling depth, held breath,
Muddy flow, terror grows,
Lost in the swell, fear's tell, 
Nature's might, fearful night.
